# Documentation Structure

## Overview
Documentation for database tables should follow a consistent and comprehensive format to ensure clarity and maintainability. The structure consists of essential sections that detail every aspect of a table's purpose, fields, relationships, and technical considerations.

## Main Documentation Sections

### 1. Purpose
A clear purpose statement contains two key elements:

**Definition:** A precise explanation of the table's role and significance within the system. This helps developers and architects understand why the table exists and what it accomplishes.

**Context:** An overview of how the table integrates with other components and contributes to the system's overall functionality. This includes its relationships and dependencies with other tables.

### 2. Fields
The fields section presents detailed information about each column in the table using a structured format. A markdown table should contain these essential columns:

| Field Name | Data Type | Constraints | Description |
|------------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| field_name | data_type | constraints | comprehensive explanation |

Each field requires thorough documentation of its exact schema name, data type specification, applicable constraints, and a detailed description of its purpose and usage within the system.

### 3. Relationships
The relationships section documents all connections between tables and includes:

**Foreign Keys:** Documentation of all foreign key relationships, specifying which tables and fields are referenced.

**Self-Referential Links:** When applicable, explanations of how the table references itself and the business logic behind such relationships.

**Association Types:** Clear specification of relationship cardinality (one-to-many, many-to-many, etc.).

**Referential Actions:** Documentation of cascading behaviors and other actions triggered by related record changes.

### 4. Type Definitions
Type definitions ensure type safety and include:

**Selection Types:** Documentation of TypeScript types used when retrieving data from the table.

**Insertion Types:** Documentation of TypeScript types required for creating new records.

## Best Practices for Documentation

### Naming Conventions
Tables and fields should follow consistent naming patterns:

**Tables:** Use snake_case and singular nouns (example: user_profile, payment_transaction)

**Fields:** Implement snake_case and include related table names for foreign keys (example: created_at, user_id)

### Data Types and Constraints
Maintain consistency across the database:

**Data Types:** Use standardized types across similar fields (example: UUID for all primary keys)

**Constraints:** Apply appropriate not-null constraints and default values to maintain data integrity

### Field Descriptions
Provide comprehensive field documentation:

**Clarity:** Write clear, concise descriptions that explain each field's purpose

**Context:** Include information about how the field integrates with application logic

### Security and Performance
Consider important technical aspects:

**Sensitive Data:** Identify fields containing sensitive information and document required security measures

**Indexing Strategy:** Document recommended indexes for optimal query performance

### Documentation Maintenance
Ensure documentation remains valuable:

**Version Control:** Keep documentation in sync with code changes

**Change History:** Maintain a log of significant schema modifications

### Audit Trail Implementation
Include standard tracking fields:

**Timestamp Fields:** created_at and updated_at for temporal tracking

**User Attribution:** created_by and updated_by for user action tracking

**Version Control:** Implement version fields for optimistic locking

This structured approach to documentation ensures that database tables are well-documented, maintainable, and clearly understood by all team members working with the system.
